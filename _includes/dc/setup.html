* [Python](http://python.org) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. For this workshop we use Python version 3.x. 
Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer. We will use Anaconda. Anaconda comes with a lot of packages pre-installed.

> ## Anaconda installation
> 
> Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).
> Remember to choose the installer for Python 3.x.

> Anaconda does not include the plotting package plotnine.  To install this package, open your terminal application and
> type:
> 
> ~~~
> conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .solution}


After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda and the workshop packages,
launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command from the terminal:

~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you wish to use a different browser, open this link: <http://localhost:8888>.

For a brief introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, please consult our [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/jupyter_notebooks/) page.
